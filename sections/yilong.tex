\begin{frame}{Application: PINN in Finance}
 
    \begin{block}{Motivation I}
    
        In the study of finance, Partially Differential Equations (PDEs) and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are widely applied to model phenomenons.  

    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Motivation II}
    
        Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provides a promising method to solve PDEs by embedding the Physic rules into the architecture and training process.

\begin{frame}{Implication and Limitation}
    1. PINNs train the Heston model adequately.

    2. The estimated mean is largely within one daily standard deviation of the ground truth, indicating that the Heston model is being learned relatively well.

    3. PINNs not only provide accurate predictions but also ensure that these predictions are consistent with known financial rules and structures. 

    4. The experiment conducted with Heston here is not feasible in reality.

\begin{frame}{Implication and Limitation}
    Is it possible to apply this approach with economic study like macroeconomics?

    Although there is no way we find a parallel universe to test our economic models, we may consider apply this theory on countries of which the characteristics converge (for example, OCED countries).
